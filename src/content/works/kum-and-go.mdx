blurb: After being acquired by Maverik, one of the largest convenience store chains in the United States, Kum & Go underwent a massive transition and rebranding of their loyalty program. Working with the Figma design system created by their awesome UX/UI team, we completely rebuilt the Kum & Go public website from Scratch within a tight deadline of four weeks.

## Project Background

<div class="hr-div"></div>

Kum & Go was acquired by Maverik, one of the largest convenience store chains in the United States in August 2023. During the following months, the two brands began to merge loyalty programs.

In February 2024, as contracts with vendors were sunsetting, we had a tight deadline to move the public website to the same internal server as maverik.com. We built the entire site with CMS integration in less than four weeks.

## A Fresh Perspective

<div class="hr-div"></div>

We didnâ€™t have access to the original codebase, so we worked with the UX/UI designers at Kum & Go to interpret the Figma design system and translate it to CSS within a fresh new codebase.

Though the original website was built with Next.js and Contentful, we built the new website using Astro, which we find to be faster and more user-friendly than Next.js in many ways. The original plan was to continue using Contentful for dynamic data, but the company ultimately decided to eliminate Contentful and use Astro Content Collections as the content management system.

Despite the tight deadline, we rebuilt the website with full functionality and CMS integration using industry-standard practices. We think it worked out well!
